# It is possible to override locking of articles by stating the section here.
# If allowPublishedOlderThanDays is set it states how many days the articles of the section is locked.
# The property allowPublishedBeforeWeekday indicates the publishing weekday of the magazine (allowed values are
# 1-7, 1=Sunday, 7=Saturday), if set the most recent allowed publishing date is calculated by first
# rolling back the allowPublishedOlderThanDays and then finding the first day with matching weekday.
# It is also possible to set the time of day.
